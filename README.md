The contents of this repo are a .NET console app that will run an approximate aggregation algorithm

To run, first save this solution locally and open with Microsoft Visual Studio

Then, build the solution.

Then, run the solution in debug mode.

To check results, put a break point at the last line of the Main method so that the console app will not exit before the variables can be looked at.

When the break point is hit, you should be able to see all of the variables and their properties. baseStation is where the final aggregate will exist

To change the landscape, you may change any of the variables that are initialized at the top of the Main method - such as:
  Number of nodes
  Communication distance
  Number of values per node
  Landscape size
